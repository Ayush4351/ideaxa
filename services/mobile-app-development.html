                        and around the world. We know that searching for a mobile app development company can be
                        difficult. The universe of consumer and business apps in the mobile arena is so diverse; it can
                        be a challenge to find a company with meaningful experience in every specialty area.

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        This is why Ideaxa’s mobile application development team puts a premium on understanding the
                        specific needs of its clients from the start. Whether your organization is just starting with
                        the development of an iPhone app, or has a team building out your existing Android platform, or
                        maybe just wants to optimize an existing mobile application, Ideaxa offers services throughout
                        the development lifecycle.

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Ideaxa works closely with its clients to determine the most suitable mobile technologies for
                        their applications. As a mobile application company with decades of experience across multiple
                        mobile application platforms, Ideaxa provides a range of options and services for its clients.

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Ideaxa can help your business build native apps for iOS, Android, and Windows Mobile which reach
                        consumers and end-users on today’s most popular devices and platforms. Our native apps ensure a
                        consistent experience and approach, regardless of how an end-user comes to see them. By applying
                        its robust testing and evaluation processes, Ideaxa ensures that its native apps are ready for
                        prime time right from the start.

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Many Ideaxa clients find that mobile optimized web applications are the best way to address
                        users across multiple mobile platforms at once. By creating a single interface which works on
                        any device through a web browser, Ideaxa can ensure a consistent approach which shortens
                        development timeframes and offers a platform-agnostic user experience. Mobile optimized web
                        applications are growing in popularity, as they present advantages over single-use native apps
                        in certain environments.

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Ideaxa takes pride in the forward-looking design and seamless user experience of its mobile
                        apps, even across the complex web of operating systems and devices. Whether your app sits on an
                        iPhone, an Android tablet, or a Windows device, Ideaxa’s engineers will craft a consistent and
                        engaging interface which promotes usability and “stickiness”. Through its long-term engagement
                        with clients, Ideaxa helps organizations adjust their mobile application strategy over time,
                        ensuring that customers return to successful, useful, intuitive apps again and again.

                        Ideaxa’s mobile app development team works fluently with iOS, Android, Windows, and
                        cross-platform technologies based on the client’s needs. Our mobile applications look great on
                        any device, from iPhones and iPads, to Android devices of all sizes and configurations, to the
                        growing number of mobile devices which use Windows. Ideaxa ensures that the user experience of
                        your mobile application is fluid and consistent, no matter which device or operating system
                        comes into play.
                    </p>
                    <h4>+ Business and Consumer</h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Today’s mobile application development requirements span the full range of consumer-facing and
                        internal business use cases. Ideaxa’s software engineers have the credentials and experience
                        necessary to build mobile applications for any purpose, in any vertical or market. We build
                        custom mobile applications for clients as diverse as shipping companies, law enforcement
                        agencies, healthcare organizations, and retail outlets. Regardless of who the end-user happens
                        to be, Ideaxa builds its apps with the client’s unique user base in mind.
                    </p>
                    <h4>+ UX/UI</h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Ideaxa is known for its simple, functional apps which create a seamless user experience. In a
                        hyper-competitive app market, we know that each program should be instantly functional and
                        self-explanatory, delivering clear value to the end-user right from the start. Drawing from our
                        strong credentials in user interface design, component architecture, and technology standards,
                        Ideaxa’s software development team builds applications which make sense. Our applications are
                        known for their elegant design and ease of use. We believe that intuitive applications are the
                        ones people use the most.
                    </p>
                    <h4>+ Back-End System</h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        No mobile application is an island. All of the valuable data generated by an app should feed
                        seamlessly into back-end CRM systems, marketing databases, and other data stores. That’s why
                        Ideaxa doesn’t just develop mobile apps – it develops the back-end systems which your mobile
                        apps feed into. Ideaxa ensures that all the information your app generates will integrate
                        properly into your existing systems.
                        Mobile apps also have to be scalable. As your business and consumer base grow, the back-end
                        systems have to be set up to receive and process ever-larger amounts of data. As additional
                        features are added to a mobile app over time, more complexity may also impact the ability of a
                        back-end system to grow and adapt. Ideaxa takes a whole-of-systems approach to mobile
                        application development, ensuring that both the app itself and the systems behind it are set up
                        for long-term success.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        The best mobile apps have business intelligence and analytic tools built in from the start.
                        Ideaxa knows that most (if not all!) of the benefit which businesses derive from mobile apps
                        comes from the data they collect form end-users or customers. Ideaxa’s engineers bring
                        experience in integration of business intelligence and analytics experience tools which help
                        clients make the most out of their mobile application.
                    </p>
                    <h4>+ Hosting Maintenance and Support</h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Ideaxa supports the full lifecycle of mobile application development. We offer ongoing
                        maintenance and support for your app as it goes into production and use. Our 24/7 support gives
                        businesses the peace of mind they need, particularly when launching a mobile app designed to
                        scale quickly in the marketplace.

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Ideaxa also offers several hosting options for its mobile applications. We can host your app and
                        the data it requires – in the cloud, in an on premise server, or in any combination of the two.
                        With experience drawn from hundreds of mobile application clients, Ideaxa can walk your business
                        or organization through the pros and cons of each option. We work with all of the major cloud
                        service providers to offer our clients any pricing model they wish to use.

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Ideaxa works closely with all of its customers, building apps through an agile process which
                        evolves along with their core needs and requirements. We work with our clients throughout the
                        development process, looping their feedback into the development cycle in a meaningful way.
                        Overall, Ideaxa takes the time to listen, incorporating the needs of businesses and end-users
                        into a coherent application development process.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Ideaxa also offers its mobile application development resources as an add-on to your existing
                        software staff. Ideaxa’s engineers can augment existing development teams, assisting in “sprint”
                        situations where timeliness is critical. We can also collaborate with your existing team to
                        speed up the mobile application development cycle, providing critical resources when it matters
                        most.
                    </p>
                    <h4>+ Mobile Application Testing and evaluation</h4>
                    <p class="text-justify">Mobile application testing is a critical component of success. Ideaxa’s
                        engineers go through a
                        robust testing process to ensure that the experience in every application is technically
                        flawless and consistent, even across platforms and devices. In the crush of short deadlines,
                        many mobile application development companies cut corners, releasing half-baked beta apps.
                        Ideaxa makes sure that all of its products are fully tested, proven mobile applications which
                        work from day one.
                        Hoping for a better reaction to your new or existing mobile application? Looking to fix some
                        bugs and glitches? Looking for a UI/UX makeover? Ideaxa offers evaluation services to clean up
                        and fix existing mobile applications. Our engineers can figure out what isn’t working on your
                        mobile applications through analysis of data produced by the app, as well as the app’s own code.
                        Based on our findings, Ideaxa can offer a clear path forward – one which ensures a consistent,
                        engaging, and ultimately satisfying approach which keeps users coming back, even across devices
                        and operating systems.
